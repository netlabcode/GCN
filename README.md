![alt text](/Images/TGC-LSTM.png)

* The 2nd version of the structure of Traffic Graph Convolutional LSTM (TGC-LSTM). 
  * ![equation](http://mathurl.com/y9brdy6u.png) is the K-th order adjacency matrix
  * ![equation](http://mathurl.com/y6w9d7bj.png) is the Free Flow Reachability matrix defined based on the network physical topology information.
* The traffic graph convolution module is designed based on the physical network topology.
* The code of this model is in the Code_V2 folder.
  * Environment (Jupyter Notebook): Python 3.6.1 and PyTorch 0.4.1
  * The code contains the implementations and results of the compared models, including LSTM, spectral graph convolution LSTM, localized spectral graph convolution LSTM.

### Dataset
The model is tested on two real-world network-wide traffic speed dataset, loop detector data and INRIX data. The following figure shows the covered areas. (a) Seattle freeway network; (b) Seattle downtown roadway network.

Check out this [Link](https://github.com/zhiyongc/Seattle-Loop-Data) for looking into and downloading the **loop detecotr dataset**. For confidentiality reasons, the **INRIX dataset** can not be shared.

To run the code, you need to download the loop detector data and the network topology information and put them in the proper "Data" folder.
